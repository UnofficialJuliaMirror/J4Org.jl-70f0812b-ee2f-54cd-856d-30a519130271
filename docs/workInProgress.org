* Change logs
** v0.1.0 -> v0.2.0
- to support [[https://github.com/QBobWatson/poporg/blob/master/poporg.el][poporg]] (also see [[https://github.com/QBobWatson/poporg][QBobWatson/poporg]]) for comment editing, comment syntax is extended: 
  - "# \plus" is processed as "#\plus"
  - "# !" is processed as "#!"
  one possible risk is than you must avoid line starting with "!"

  You can install poporg from MELPA. Configuration is:
  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (autoload 'poporg-dwim "poporg" nil t)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c \"") 'poporg-dwim)
  #+END_EXAMPLE
- add support for =@enum=
* W3 Links
